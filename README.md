# Dog-Breed-Project

## Project Overview
Dog breed classifier project is the last one in the Data Scientist Capstone in the Udacity. Moreover, this project focus on image processing and it use deep learning to detect the images. The project contain different functionality as the program will classify the images as following:
*•	If the image contain dog, the program will return the predicted breed.
*•	If the image contain human, the program will return the resembling dog breed.
*•	If the image contain neither, the program will return an output that indicates an error.

## Implementation Overview
In this project we detect a dog images using the pre-trained model. After that I applied Keras along with CNN model. Lastly, for the CNN model I use the pre-trained model along with Transfer Learning technique. Firstly, I loaded the required datasets after that I had write the function to detect human face and dog accept the images as input. Moreover, I have Create a CNN from scratch to classify dog breeds and improve it. 



## Import Datasets
Following datasets are given by Udacity and it`s required to run project. 
* The dog dataset
*	The human dataset

## Acknowldgements
The codes in the template folder are belong to the Udacity.
